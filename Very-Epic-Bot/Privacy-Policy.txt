By adding this bot to your server, or being in a server with the bot within it, you are by fourth, accepting the privacy policy.

1. I collect your messages
    Before you ask any questions, this is for moderation of whom is allowed to use my bot. If I see a message that breaks TOS, I will ban you. I will try to remove as much as possible every Sunday at around 8:00 (GMT). I do not sell data from you, nor do I intend to in the future.

2. I can message you at any time through the bot
    This is just so I can communicate things if I need to. This will be used sparingly. I may use this to ask for feedback on previously added features from random people whom use this bot, but this may be done on very rare occasions.

3. I can join your server whenever
    Once again, for communication purposes. I will leave after I say what I need to. Sending messages through the bot is more time consuming than doing this, yet I will still try to avoid it.

If this conflicts with Discord's TOS, or Discord's API's TOS, please inform me so I can fix any issues as soon as possible.
