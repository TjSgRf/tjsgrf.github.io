By adding this bot to your server, or being in a server with the bot within it, you are by fourth, accepting the TOS.

1. No discriminitory practises
    You are not allowed to discriminate against any community. No racism, no homophobia, no transphobia, ect. I do accept making fun of the french army for being absolute fucking trash though.

2. No harassment
    Don't harass anyone. Should be easy enough to understand.

3. My decision is final
    If you find yourself banned from my bot, I will not be doing any ban requests. If you're banned, you're banned. Bans could be from not following TOS, or just being a total fucking douchebag. Looking at you JOSH. YEAH, FUCK YOU.

More will likely be added in the future.
