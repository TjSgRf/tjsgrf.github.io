By adding this bot to your server, or being in a server with the bot within it, you are by fourth, accepting the TOS.

1. No discriminatory practices
    You are not allowed to discriminate against any community. No racism, no homophobia, no transphobia, ect. I do accept making fun of the French army for being absolute fucking trash though, but only in good faith.

2. No harassment
    Don't harass anyone. Should be easy enough to understand.

3. My decisions are final
    Most of the time, I won't be doing ban appeals, but if you want to submit one, send it to niko_oneshot_enjoyer on Discord. Spamming me will make you less likely to be unbanned. If you're banned, it's usually final. Bans could be from not following TOS, or just being what I see as a person who I do not wish to be associated with me or my projects.

4. No overloading the bot
    Don't make too many requests with commands too quickly, as the bot will heavily slow down if you do. That's all.

More will likely be added in the future.
