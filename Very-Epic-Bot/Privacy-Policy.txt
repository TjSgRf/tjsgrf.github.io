By adding this bot to your server, or being in a server with the bot within it, you are by fourth, accepting the privacy policy.

1. I collect your messages
    Before you throw a total fucking temper tantrum, this is to moderate people who use my bot. If I see a message that breaks TOS, I will ban you.

2. I can message you at any time through the bot
    This is just so I can communicate things if I need to.

3. I can join your server whenever
    Once again, for communication purposes. I will leave after I say what I need to. Sending stuff through the bot is more time consuming than doing this, yet I will still try to avoid it.

If any of these break Discord TOS or Discord's API TOS, than I don't know if it does or not. Please tell me if it does.
